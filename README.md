# Vue Resources App

This is a simple project I built as learning vuejs. And in this project I learned how to:

* [x] - use components in vuejs
* [x] - use the vue "component" to render components dynamically
* [x] - use the "keep-alive" in vue to control the caching of dynamic components"
* [x] - work with local storage in vue
* [x] - understand vue component folder structure and architecture
* [x] - style vue components either scoped or globally
* [x] - work with global and local components
* [x] - use the provide and inject properties to pass down props and methods without passing through unneccessary component or components where the particular is not been used
* [x] how to use refs to fetching values from form inputs
* [x] use "teleport" component for accessibility
